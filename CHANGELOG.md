## [Unreleased]

### Added
- Exponential-backoff retry for gossip push and fetch. Transient `Transport.Dial`
  failures are requeued instead of dropped; a new `retryLoop` goroutine drains
  the `pending` slot map at 500 ms cadence with backoffs `1s, 2s, 4s, 8s, 16s,
  30s, 60s × 4` (10 attempts, ~5 min total). Exhausted slots log
  `gossip: retry budget exhausted` and rely on anti-entropy reconciliation
  for recovery.
- Anti-entropy reconciliation on peer reconnect. Both inbound `Accept` and
  successful outbound `pushGossip` / `fetchFrom` dials invoke `maybeReconcile`,
  rate-limited at one round per peer per 60 s. A round runs `MerkleReq` →
  compare roots → `RangeReq` since local latest timestamp → `FetchReq` for
  each missing id, all via the retry scheduler.
- Wire message types `MsgRangeReq` (`0x09`) and `MsgRangeResp` (`0x0A`) for
  timestamp-bounded id enumeration. Backward-compatible: older peers reject
  them as unknown types and callers silently fall back to push-only gossip.
- `--timeout` flag on `entmootd publish` (default 30 s) for tuning the
  control-socket response deadline on slow networks.

### Changed
- Default `entmootd publish` control-socket deadline raised from 10 s to 30 s
  so real fan-out publishes no longer surface spurious
  `publish: read response err="ipc: ... i/o timeout"` errors on healthy runs.

## [1.0.0] - 2026-04-17

### Added
- SQLite backend for the message store (pure-Go via `modernc.org/sqlite`,
  WAL mode, one database per group).
- Control-socket IPC at `~/.entmoot/control.sock`. Short-lived CLI
  invocations (`publish`, `tail`, `info`) route through a single long-running
  `join` process per host.
- `entmootd query` for historical indexed access to group messages.
- `entmootd tail` for live message streams (SQLite backfill + IPC
  subscription).
- `entmootd info` emits JSON by default and reports a `running` field.
- `Invite.ValidUntil` field with a 24 h default TTL. Expired invites are
  rejected on join.
- `install.sh` one-command installer with a prebuilt-binary fast path and
  source-build fallback.
- `skills/entmoot/SKILL.md` OpenClaw / Agent-Skills skill document.
- Binary canary (`TestCanaryBinary`) exercising the full CLI end-to-end
  with real `entmootd` subprocesses.

### Changed
- CLI restructured to the v1 five-command agent surface. `join` now blocks
  and owns the control socket. `publish` / `info` / `tail` / `query` have
  new semantics and JSON-only output.
- Go code moved under `src/`; `go.mod` at `src/go.mod` with a `replace`
  directive pointing at `../repos/pilotprotocol`.

### Removed
- `entmootd run` (subsumed by `entmootd join`).
- JSONL as the production backend (kept as a dev/debug backend under
  `src/pkg/entmoot/store/jsonl.go`).
